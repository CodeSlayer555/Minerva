# Minerva - Tutor-Tutee Connection Platform

## Introduction

Minerva, named after the Roman goddess of wisdom, represents our vision to provide a seamless platform to connect tutors and tutees, thus facilitating knowledge exchange. Our goal is to address the challenges in the current tuition-matching ecosystem, notably the surprising lack of integrated tuition platforms which are often unorganized and inefficient.

## Background

Our motivation to embark on this project stemmed from personal experiences in seeking tutoring positions during our university days. The struggle to find a suitable platform led to the inception of Minerva.

Existing solutions, including various agencies and Telegram bots, are typically unorganized, with a rapid velocity of messages that make it easy to miss potential opportunities. Moreover, the manual processing involved in some agency websites can take up to one working day for a response, which is not ideal for urgent tutoring needs.

## The Problem

The tuition industry is ripe with potentials yet hindered by poorly designed systems. Existing platforms suffer from slow processes, indirect communication through agencies, and hefty fees, making it difficult for tutors to find specialized subjects and for tutees to connect with suitable tutors.

## Our Mission

We aim to streamline the process by creating an open platform for direct communication between tutors and tutees, eliminating the need for intermediaries and, consequently, additional fees.

### User Stories

- Tutors and tutees should be able to create and apply to listings with ease.
- Users should be able to negotiate terms directly and leave reviews for transparency and informed decision-making.

## How Are We Different?

Minerva distinguishes itself from the competition by offering:

- **Clear, Organized Listings**: Easily navigable listings with real-time updates.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored suggestions to match tutors with tutees.
